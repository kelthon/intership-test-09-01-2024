# Technical Test

This repository is my answer to an internal technical test where I'm using typescript and nodeJS to solve it

## How to run

first of all install nodejs and npm and copy and paste the following commands

```sh
npm install -g ts-node typescript # To install typescript and ts-node
```

now use `ts-node` to run any answer

```sh
ts-node <path-to-file>
```

e.g.

```sh
ts-node ./src/first.ts
```
